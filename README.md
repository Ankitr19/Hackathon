SDS hackathon sponsored by Raxor Pay

##Idea
The idea was to check the availibility of Proffesor.
As we go to profs. office/chamber many times we doesn't found him or he was busy in his work and told to come after some time, and we have to come back.Due to this, our so much time wastes and our interest also goes down. 

So what we have done is, we made an app and web portal for student to check his(proffesor) availibility before he goes to his room and in proffessor's desktop we made an setup in it by installing curl and adding bash script files, so that he get dialogue box after 15 to 30 sec. of opening his laptop. 
In dialogue box, we ask him to be available for student or not. If prof. click no, all thing went stop.
